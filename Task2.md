# Project Proposal: AI-Powered Data Quality Analyst for the Client

## Executive Summary

The client gathers valuable data from numerous sources, but ensuring and maintaining high data quality is a persistent challengeâ€”especially for non-technical users. To unlock the full potential of this data, we propose the development of an **AI-Powered Data Quality Analyst**.

This solution will provide an intuitive, chat-based user interface where your team members can ask questions about the data in plain English (e.g., "How many customer records have missing phone numbers?" or "Show me sales outliers from last quarter"). More importantly, the platform will proactively monitor, analyze, and report on data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, anomalies, and data consistency problems. An advanced AI model will translate user questions and automated checks into precise SQL queries, execute them against your database, and return the answers in a clear, actionable format.

**Key Business Value:**

- **Proactive Data Quality Monitoring:** Automatically identify and report missing values, duplicates, outliers, and schema inconsistencies.
- **Data Quality Insights for Everyone:** Empower business users to understand and improve data quality without needing to write code or rely on technical teams.
- **Increase Efficiency:** Get answers to data quality questions and issues in seconds, not hours or days.
- **Drive Better Decisions:** Ensure that business decisions are based on high-quality, reliable data.
- **Full Oversight & Control:** A built-in monitoring platform will track all AI interactions, data quality metrics, and remediation actions for performance, cost, and quality evaluation.
- **Become Data Driven:** Foster a culture where decisions are guided by real-time, high-quality data insights accessible to everyone.

This proposal outlines a 10-week plan to develop a robust Minimum Viable Product (MVP), delivering a secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform focused on data quality.

## Technical Design

We recommend a modern, modular architecture that is both scalable and maintainable, with a strong focus on data quality monitoring and reporting.

### Architecture Overview

The system will consist of six core components that work together to deliver a seamless, monitored, and data-quality-focused experience.

```

        |                                            v                                               v
        +------------------------------------+-----------------+                           +-----------------+
                     6. Formats results      |                 |                           |                 |
                     and sends back          |  Query Engine & |<--------------------------+   AI Core (LLM) |
                                             |  Your SQL DB    |     (Logs stored here)      | (e.g., GPT-4)   |
                                             +-----------------+                           +-----------------+
```

**Flow:**

1. **User Input:** The user types a question or requests a data quality report in the web-based UI.
2. **API Request:** The UI sends the question or data quality check request to the secure Backend Server.
3. **AI Gateway & Logging:** The Backend Server forwards the request to the AI Gateway & Monitoring Service. This critical component logs the incoming request, then forwards it to the AI Core (LLM).
4. **AI Translation & Evaluation:** The AI Core generates the SQL query for the data quality check or user question. The response is sent back to the Gateway, which logs the AI's response, latency, and evaluates the quality of the generated SQL (e.g., is it valid?).
5. **Secure Execution:** The Gateway returns the validated SQL to the Backend Server, which executes the query against your database.
6. **Response Generation:** The query results are processed and formatted into a human-friendly response, with a focus on highlighting data quality issues and actionable recommendations.
7. **Display:** The final answer or data quality report is sent back to the User Interface and displayed to the user.

### Technologies Used

- **User Interface (Frontend):** React.js. A leading JavaScript library for building modern, fast, and interactive user interfaces.
- **Backend Server (API):** Python with the FastAPI framework. Python is perfect for AI integrations, and FastAPI is a high-performance framework for building the API that connects all the components.
- **AI Core:** OpenAI's GPT-4 API. Or any other provider. This state-of-the-art model provides excellent natural language understanding and SQL generation capabilities, including for data quality checks.
- **AI Gateway & Monitoring:** This will be a custom Python service. For the MVP, it will log all AI call data (request, response, latency, cost tokens, validity) and data quality metrics to a dedicated table in the main SQL Database. This provides immediate traceability and data quality oversight.
- **Database Connection:** SQLAlchemy. A powerful Python toolkit that can securely and efficiently connect to virtually any SQL database.

### Deployment Plan

We propose a cloud-native deployment to ensure scalability, security, and high availability.

- **Cloud Provider:** We recommend using a major cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure.

**Infrastructure:**

- The Backend Server and AI Gateway will be "containerized" using Docker and run on a managed service (e.g., AWS Fargate or Google Cloud Run). This allows the application to scale automatically based on demand.
- The User Interface will be deployed as a static web application.
- **Environments:** We will set up separate Development, Staging, and Production environments.

## Project Planning

We propose an agile, 10-week development plan to deliver the initial version of the product, with a strong focus on data quality features.

### Development Plan (8-10-Week MVP)

**Week 1: Foundations & Project Kickoff**
- Conduct a detailed workshop to finalize requirements and user stories, with a focus on data quality needs.
- Set up the cloud infrastructure, code repositories, and development environments.
- Create the basic "skeleton" for the Frontend and Backend applications.

**Week 2-3: Core Backend & AI Integration**
- Establish a secure connection to a test version of your database.
- Develop the AI Gateway for routing, logging, and evaluating AI provider calls.
- Build the core logic for sending requests through the Gateway and receiving the generated SQL.
- Implement initial security checks for the SQL queries.
- Begin implementing automated data quality checks (e.g., null counts, duplicate detection, outlier analysis).

**Week 4: User Interface & API Connection**
- Develop the main chat interface where users will interact with the AI.
- Build the display area for viewing responses (text and simple tables).
- Connect the UI to the Backend API to create the first end-to-end version.
- Add UI components for data quality reports and alerts.

**Week 5: Response Handling & Refinement**
- Improve the formatting of AI responses (e.g., better tables, natural language summaries).
- Enhance the AI's ability to handle more complex data quality questions based on early testing.
- Begin testing with a small group of pilot users and sample data.

**Week 6: Testing, Security & Monitoring Dashboard**
- Conduct thorough end-to-end testing to find and fix bugs.
- Perform a security audit, focusing on preventing any form of "SQL injection".
- Build a basic internal dashboard to view AI call logs, data quality metrics, and performance.
- Optimize application performance and reliability.

**Week 6-8: Deployment & Handover**
- Deploy the application to the production environment.
- Prepare user documentation and technical documentation, with a focus on data quality features.
- Conduct a training and handover session with the client team.

**Buffer Weeks: Unexpected Requests & Change Management**

To ensure a smooth delivery and accommodate any unforeseen requirements or change requests, we recommend adding a **2-week buffer** after the main development and deployment phases. This buffer will allow us to:

- Address any last-minute feedback or feature requests from stakeholders.
- Resolve unexpected technical challenges or integration issues.
- Refine the user experience based on initial user feedback.
- Ensure thorough documentation and knowledge transfer.

**Total Estimated Timeline:** 8-10 weeks (including buffer)

### Resources Needed

We recommend a small, focused team for this initial project.

- **1x Full-Stack Developer:** Responsible for building the React frontend and supporting backend features, with a strong understanding on cloud DevOps setup, containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud deployment.
- **1x Machine Learning Engineer:** Specializes in LLM (Large Language Model) deployment and end-to-end solution implementation, including prompt engineering, model integration, and performance optimization. This role will also take on part of the Scrum responsibilities (e.g., sprint planning, backlog grooming), though these responsibilities are shared collaboratively across the team.
- **1x Backend Engineer:** Focused on building and maintaining the Python FastAPI backend, implementing secure API endpoints, integrating with the AI Gateway, and ensuring robust database connectivity and query execution.
  - If an **AI Monitoring Platform** is required, the Backend Engineer will also be responsible for:
    - Designing and implementing logging mechanisms to capture all AI interactions (requests, responses, latency, cost, and validity).
    - Building secure API endpoints and database schemas for storing and retrieving monitoring data.
    - Developing backend logic for metrics aggregation, error tracking, and performance reporting.
    - Supporting the integration of the monitoring dashboard with the frontend/admin UI.
    - Ensuring compliance with data privacy and security standards for all logged information.
  - For data quality, the Backend Engineer will:
    - Implement automated data quality checks (nulls, duplicates, outliers, schema validation).
    - Develop APIs for surfacing data quality metrics and reports to the frontend and admin dashboard.
    - Support alerting and notification mechanisms for critical data quality issues.

## UI Mockup (Low-Fidelity)

The user interface will be designed for simplicity and ease of use, with a strong emphasis on data quality visibility.

### End-User Interface

This interface resembles a familiar chat application.

**Key UI Elements:**

- **Schema Explorer (Left Sidebar):** An optional panel showing available tables and columns.
- **Chat Window (Center):** The main interaction area for questions and answers.
- **Input Bar (Bottom):** Where the user types their question.
- **Response Area:** Displays AI answers as text, tables, or download links.
- **Data Quality Alerts:** Prominent display of data quality issues, warnings, and recommendations.
- **Data Quality Reports:** On-demand or scheduled reports summarizing data quality metrics and trends.

### Admin Platform Monitoring Dashboard

In addition to the end-user UI, an internal dashboard will be created for system administrators and project owners. This will not be a full mockup at this stage but will be a simple, data-dense interface providing:

- A real-time log of all questions asked and the SQL generated by the AI.
- Metrics for each call: latency, cost (token usage), and whether the query was successful.
- Data quality metrics and trends (e.g., null counts, duplicate rates, anomaly detection results).
- Filters to search for specific user interactions, error types, or data quality issues.

## Next Steps

We are confident that this AI-Powered Data Quality Analyst will provide significant value to the client by making data quality visible, actionable, and accessible to everyone.
