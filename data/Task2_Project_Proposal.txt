Task 2: Project Proposal

Prepare a project proposal for the client. It should include:

- Technical design:
    - Architecture overview:
        • The solution consists of the following main components:
            - Data Sources: Various structured data files (e.g., CSV, Excel) or databases from which data is collected.
            - Data Ingestion Layer: Responsible for loading and preprocessing data into a unified format (using Python and pandas).
            - Data Storage: Data is stored in-memory as pandas DataFrames for fast access and analysis (no external database required for PoC).
            - AI Query Engine: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini to translate user questions into SQL queries and data analysis instructions.
            - SQL Execution Layer: Uses pandasql to execute SQL queries on the in-memory DataFrames.
            - User Interface: A Streamlit-based web app that allows users to upload data, ask questions, and view results interactively.
        • Interaction flow:
            1. User uploads data or selects sample data via the web interface.
            2. User asks a question in natural language.
            3. The AI Query Engine generates a SQL query based on the question and the data schema.
            4. The SQL Execution Layer runs the query on the loaded data.
            5. Results are displayed to the user in the web interface, with options to view the SQL, save favorites, or retry queries.
    - Technologies used:
        • What do you want to use to build this?
        • Which components will use which technologies?
    - Deployment plan:
        • What infrastructure requirements will the solution have?
- Project planning:
    - Development plan:
        • Weekly breakdown of the development.
        • How many weeks do you need?
        • What will be done each week?
    - Resources needed:
        • How many people do you need?
        • What kind of profiles?
- UI mockup:
    - Low fidelity sketch of user interface
